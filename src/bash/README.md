# Bash (Bourne Again SHell)

I ran this using the bash.exe that comes with the windows [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installation. You'll also need the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command line utility, as I decided to use that as the thing to parse the json with.

```
> bash script.sh
```
